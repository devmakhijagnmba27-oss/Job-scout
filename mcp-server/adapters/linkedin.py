"""LinkedIn adapter — unauthenticated public guest endpoints. OPT-IN ONLY.

⚠️ ToS WARNING: LinkedIn's User Agreement prohibits automated access, and
LinkedIn exposes no official jobs API. This adapter exists as an explicit,
documented owner decision (specs/technical_design.md §5 Tier C; CLAUDE.md
constraint 4): most postings — especially internships — appear on LinkedIn
first. Every mitigation below is deliberate; do not weaken them:

- Hard-gated: available() is False unless the profile sets BOTH
  `linkedin` in sources.enabled AND sources.linkedin_tos_acknowledged.
- No login, no cookies, no credentials — only the same public guest
  endpoints a logged-out browser sees, under the honest JobScout
  User-Agent. Nothing ties the traffic to the user's LinkedIn account,
  so the realistic worst case is an IP rate-limit, not an account ban.
- Minimal volume: at most MAX_SEARCH_ROUNDS (2) search requests per run —
  round 2 only fires when outcome-driven deepening is starved, with a
  DIFFERENT keyword (rotation), never page-scrolling — plus at most
  MAX_DETAIL_FETCHES description fetches per search, ≥1s apart. The cap
  is stateless (`query.page > 2 → []`), so no caller can push past it.
- Any 429/999 (LinkedIn's rate-limit codes) aborts every remaining
  LinkedIn request for this run.
- Server-side f_JT/f_WT filters narrow the search, but are NOT trusted as
  ground truth — LinkedIn's guest search does not strictly enforce them,
  so every result's employment_type is still inferred from its own title
  (and description, once fetched), never assumed from the request filter.
