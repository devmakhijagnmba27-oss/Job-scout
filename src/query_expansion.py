"""Deterministic query expansion for job search.

COURSE CONCEPT (retrieval design — recall vs. precision separation):
the keyword match against a job board is a RECALL filter — its job is to
surface every plausibly-relevant posting. PRECISION is the scorer's job:
it ranks each candidate 0-100 on skills/role/industry/etc. Exact-phrase
matching conflated the two — "Machine Learning Engineer" (verbatim) misses
a posting titled "ML Engineer" or "Machine Learning Scientist", so the same
handful of jobs surfaced every run and the seen-dedup then starved results.

This module widens the net deterministically (no LLM, no prompt-injection
surface): each target role expands into its seniority-stripped core, its
role-noun-stripped domain, and known abbreviation equivalents (ML ↔ machine
learning, AI ↔ artificial intelligence). Weak matches still surface but
simply score low downstream — they are no longer silently excluded.

Anchored word-boundary matching in adapters/base.matches_keywords() keeps
the short abbreviations ("ml", "ai") safe from substring false positives.
