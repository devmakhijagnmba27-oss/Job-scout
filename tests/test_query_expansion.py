"""Tests for deterministic query expansion (src/query_expansion.py).

The point of expansion is recall: exact-phrase role titles match almost
nothing on real boards, so the same handful of jobs surfaced every run.
These lock in that broadening happens, stays deterministic, keeps the
primary role first (LinkedIn searches only keywords[0]), and doesn't emit
dangerous single-word tokens.
